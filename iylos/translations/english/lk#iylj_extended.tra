@49   = ~That is your prerogative.  I will inform them when I have the chance, I can...assure you.~

@51   = ~I apologise, that was...untactful of me.  What happened to you was regretful, and such atrocities should never be forced upon anyone...even a Bhaalspawn.  That does not change the fact that you are famous--infamous, some would say, and that there are many interested in what you stand for.~
@52   = ~Surely you know that by now.  Regardless, the road lies before us, eager to be trodden upon.  Let us oblige, and end this fruitless conversation.~

@55   = ~As I have said, I would prefer not to invade your privacy; but the circumstances dictate that I do, and for that I apologise.  You are, however, infamous--or famous, whichever you prefer, so you should know there are *many* interested in who you are and what you stand for.~

@89   = ~Does anyone *care*?  I help those who need it the most, not just every peasant who comes to me begging for gold.~

@99   = ~Evasion is the soul of courtesy, after all.~
@100  = ~Bah!  It is impossible to hold a sensible conversation with you.  Get you gone!~
@101  = ~Perhaps, but you evaded my question--it is only fair that I evade yours.~
@102  = ~You really *are* pathetic, Iylos.  There is more to life than serving others.~

@105  = ~Well...at least try my damnedest to.~
@106  = ~I suppose you are right, in a way; but even still, it is my motivation.~
@107  = ~(laugh) You have a point, <CHARNAME>.  All causes are naive in some way; the fight against evil is neverending, ceaseless, as evil will always find a way to exist--yet there are continually people who try to 'defeat' it, knowing it is only temporary.  It *does* serve a purpose--it keeps the balance from shifting too much in either direction.~

@109  = ~As you said--all causes are naive.~
@110  = ~Point taken.~

@116  = ~Bah!  Is there any *point* in talking?!~
@117  = ~And perhaps you will, but in my experience there is no way to stop something as large as a war without murder and bloodshed, regardless.  War begets more war.  Murder begets more murder.  There is no way to stop it without more war, and surely that is not what you want?~
@118  = ~I will do what I must.~
@119  = ~I...I guess not.  But there has to be another way...~
@120  = ~Then I will kill the leaders, and the rest will fall into disarray.~
@121  = ~Well, what do you suggest then, o all knowing monk?~
@122  = ~That is one way to do it; a disgusting, vile solution to a disgusting, vile reality.  But murder begets more murder, <CHARNAME>; death begets more death.  Surely that is not what you want?~
@123  = ~I understand that, <CHARNAME>.  But if you believe that stopping the war is your purpose, you must have a way to do so or you will be running blind.  Are you so ignorant that you don't see that?~
@124  = ~I'm not ignorant, Iylos.  I know the consequences of walking in blind, but I don't have much choice here.  I've been forced into a role I don't want to play, but the more I evade it, the more I am forced to take an active role in it.~
@125  = ~I will find a way.~
@126  = ~Perhaps...perhaps I am.  I don't know anymore.~
@127  = ~How dare you?!~
@128  = ~There are others who cannot be helped, <CHARNAME>, and those who do not *want* to be helped.  When you give to the poor or donate to charity, you may believe you are doing good when in fact it may just be the opposite which is occuring.~
@129  = ~So what, I shouldn't give money to the poor, or donate to charity?~
@130  = ~That's a very cynical view, Iylos.~
@131  = ~How terrible it must be for you to look out to the world with such a view.~
@132  = ~Of course there are--I give to those who need it, and only if it will actually help them.  I do what I can.~
@133  = ~Are you calling me evil?~
@134  = ~Fair enough, I suppose.  But when you give to charity, you may believe you are doing good when in fact it may just be the opposite occuring.~
@135  = ~Of course.~
@136  = ~Look, <CHARNAME>, I- I barely know you, so I have no reason to share anything with you.  Perhaps another time.~
@137  = ~No, it cannot.  The fight against evil is neverending, ceaseless, as evil will always find a way to exist--yet there are continually people who try to 'defeat' it, knowing it is only temporary.  It *does* serve a purpose--it keeps the balance from shifting too much in either direction.~

@140  = ~Balance isn't always achievable, but we should continually strive toward it.  Even you, <CHARNAME>, even one as turbulent as you can achieve balance if you try hard enough.  Perhaps.~
@141  = ~If you believe so.~
@142  = ~Motivation is everything; whether you're forced or not, you must have motivation or you wouldn't continue.~
@143  = ~Perhaps.~
@144  = ~If that is what you want to think, Iylos.~
@145  = ~Balance isn't always achievable, but we should continually strive toward it.  Even you one as hopeless and turbulent as you can achieve balance if you try hard enough.  Perhaps.  Whether you would even bother trying, of course, is debatable.  Bah.~
@146  = ~Perhaps not, if you're not going to listen.  (sigh)~
@147  = ~Of course there would be, but it is up to you to find it.~
@148  = ~I don't know--you're the leader of this group, Bhaalspawn.  Think for yourself.~
@149  = ~At least you're willing to admit that, I suppose.  You cannot evade destiny, according to many--I would like to believe we have choice in this life.  Some of us, perhaps...but perhaps not such as you.~
@150  = ~Perhaps, but it is up to you to find it.~
@151  = ~I dare because I must.  You *will* die if you don't know what you're doing--you'll walk in blinded on either side, and someone will come from behind.  Think it through carefully, <CHARNAME>.  Decide on a course of action, and follow it.~
@152  = ~Perhaps you should take your own advice on occasion, Iylos.~
@153  = ~Whatever.~
@154  = ~If you say so.~
@155  = ~I'm not saying that--I'm saying be wary of your actions, for you might not always know the course of what will happen.

I was told by Balthazar that if you were amiable to his cause, to give you the opportunity to learn some of these techniques.  He taught them to me, and they are in truth simple exercises to help control the mind and calm the spirit.~
@170  = ~I'm debating whether it is worth teaching you, or not- I'm even going so far as to give you the option, when perhaps I should not.~
@171  = ~I would be glad to learn some of these 'exercises', Iylos, if it will help control this...thing...inside me.  I don't like having the essence of a murderous dead god playing me like a harp.~

The light uses your heart as a focus, and radiates back out to your fingers, spreading to your stomach, your legs, your toes.~

@215  = ~Wow...what *was* that?  I felt so serene, so at peace--I'm not...I feel almost like Bhaal can't touch me.  Like for once, I'm the one who has the murder in check.~
@216  = ~Wasn't that just a normal meditation?  I've done such things before, and that was no different.  Nonetheless...I do feel a little better.  Thank you.~
@217  = ~That was pathetic.  You think a combination of words and dramatic pauses can stop my Bhaal essence from 'taking over' me?  Hah.  A completely wasteful lack of sleep...surely I could have spent it better than *that*.~
@218  = ~It is a simple meditation, <CHARNAME.  It will not cause you any harm at all, I promise you--Balthazar taught it to me as a young monk, and found that it helped him to bring peace to his conflicted existance.  It helps to calm the mind, still the onslaught of thoughts and emotions, and bring serenity upon you.  Shall we start?~

@243  = ~Nah, actually, I've changed my mind.  No thanks.~
@244  = ~<CHARMAME>, you are a fool.~
@245  = ~<CHARNAME>, I have...something I wish to impart to you.~ [LK#I161]
@246  = ~No!  No, do not say anything.  I do not want to hear it right now.~ [LK#I162]
@247  = ~My actions towards you have been...regrettable.  I have been callous, rude, and unkind, and this is not the way one should treat his companions.~
@248  = ~I did not want to believe you could be human.  I wanted to believe you some monstrous beast in human guise, who would snap momentarily and slaughter every man, woman and child around <PRO_HIMHER>.~
@249  = ~I was wrong.  And I understand if you do not wish me to be in this party anymore, I just wished to tell you that- I, it was not my intention to be so rude to you, nor your companions.~
@250  = ~Why apologise, Iylos?  It's already forgiven.~
@251  = ~ I kept you with me because you were a good meat-shield, and I...I thought you should know that.  If you'd like to leave, that's okay.~
@252  = ~I see.  Well, that's too bad.  You can leave now, Iylos.~
@253  = ~You can be so stupid sometimes, Iylos, you really can.  (sigh)~
@254  = ~Then let us continue--but still, I made a mistake.  I judged you prematurely, and I would not like to make the mistake again.  I...thank you, <CHARNAME>, for putting up with my behaviour.  Perhaps we can be more cordial in future.~
@255  = ~How very droll, <CHARNAME>.~
@256  = ~I wasn't joking.~
@257  = ~Thanks.  Your apology is accepted, Iylos, but--I swear, if you try to get me to meditate again, I will start to tear out my hair.~
@258  = ~Droll?  Me?  Never.~
@259  = ~Glad you liked it.  Now, get lost.  I've no need for you in my party if you're going to apologise like some pansy!~
@260  = ~If I...must.  Perhaps we shall meet again, <CHARNAME>.~
@261  = ~Occasionally, yes, I can.  What say you, <CHARNAME>?  Do you accept my apology--even though perhaps it was not the wisest of actions, in retrospect...bah.~
@262  = ~Apology accepted, Iylos.  Don't worry about it.  We're all a little snarky sometimes.~
@263  = ~I can't accept your apology, Iylos, but please stay with the group.  You are rather useful, I'll give you that.~
@264  = ~I'm not sure.  Maybe.  Give me some time to think about it.~
@265  = ~No.  Just...just leave, Iylos.  Please.~
@266  = ~I see.  In that case, perhaps I should leave.~
@267  = ~No, please stay.  You may be a meatshield, but you're a *good* meatshield!~
@268  = ~You can stay.  For now.~
@269  = ~Goodbye, then.  Fare thee well!~
@270  = ~I will...try.  I cannot promise such a feat, however- but surely the lure of meditation will grasp you eventually.~
@271  = ~Of course not.~
@272  = ~So I am to be used as a meatshield, then.  I suppose there is nothing for it.~
@273  = ~So, I am to be used as a meatshield, then.  I await your answer.~
@274  = ~<CHARNAME>, your pack is open- here...~ [LK#I231]
@275  = ~There we are, fixed.~
@276  = ~Did you just do something...kind?  For me?  Who are you, and what have you done with Iylos?!~
@277  = ~Thanks, Iylos.  I didn't realise it had come open.~
@278  = ~It's all almost over, isn't it?  Oh, thank you.  Ah, I wish it didn't come down to these battles- I wish there was another way to do this.  (sigh)~
@279  = ~I could have done that myself, Iylos.~
@280  = ~Are you insinuating that I am anything less than courteous, <CHARNAME>?~
@281  = ~...what?  Why're you looking at me like that?~
@282  = ~You honestly can't have just said that.  Iylos, you're one of the most terrible people I know.  You really are.  (laugh)~
@283  = ~Ah...no reason.  No reason at all.~
@284  = ~You're being sarcastic, right?  Anything less than courteous?  Hah!  Now *that* is a joke.~
@285  = ~Iylos, you're a rude, obnoxious twat!  You've even admitted it!~
@286  = ~No problem, <CHARNAME>.  I just hate to see things out of order, is all.  I've noticed that you aren't the most...organised person, sometimes.~
@287  = ~I'm just trying to help out however I can.~
@288  = ~I know my faults.  You don't need to lord them over me.~
@289  = ~I am so!  As you'll recall, it was I who organised *your* pack last night, Iylos.~
@290  = ~No, I'm not.  But I'm more intelligent than you.~
@291  = ~So do I.  But it seems there is no other way, as it is...unless some miracle were to occur, we're stuck fighting.  I suppose there isn't much for it but to keep going--it's either us, or them, at this point.~
@292  = ~That's a rather drastic turnaround, Iylos.  What provoked this change of view?~
@293  = ~I know what you mean.  (sigh)~
@294  = ~Well, we can always pray.~
@295  = ~I'm sure you could, but it is always easier for someone else to do it.  And I know your penchant for being unorganised; you could have forgotten about it, and lost something important.~
@296  = ~If you say so, <CHARNAME>.  At least I can't compare to your cooking, however...simply atrocious.~
@297  = ~Ah, but don't worry.  We have at least one consummate cook in this party.~
@298  = ~You can...cook?  Since when?  Why haven't you said this before?!~
@299  = ~My cooking is wonderful!  It is *yours* which is to be deplored!~
@300  = ~My cooking is fine, Iylos.  Perhaps it is your tastebuds which have failed you.~
@301  = ~Well, you can cook from now on then, if you are such a consummate chef!  I would be happy to give up the job.~
@302  = ~Lucky I'm not the one who cooks, then.~
@303  = ~You can always go without food, if you want.~
@304  = ~Of course I do.  *Someone* has to make sure you don't get conceited, after all.~
@305  = ~Ah...true.  Even still, you're remarkably unorganised...for...~
@306  = ~I've really lost that, haven't I?  (sigh)~
@307  = ~Yep.  I got you good.~
@308  = ~Bwahahaha.~
@309  = ~Don't worry about it, Iylos.  *Someone* has to make sure you don't get conceited, after all.~
@310  = ~If you say so, <CHARNAME>.  I can't say the same about you when you cook, however...simply atrocious.  (laugh)~
@311  = ~Extensive thinking.  Contemplation.  Listening to you.~
@312  = ~You mean you *do* listen to me?  Wow.  That's a relief.~
@313  = ~Well, it's a lovely change.  Keep it up.~
@314  = ~Eh.  I think I preferred the old 'stop fighting you are a horrible person', honestly.~
@315  = ~Indeed we can, <CHARNAME>.  Indeed we can.~
@316  = ~Mostly because I enjoyed watching you struggle with the fire.  If you wish, I could cook, from now on.~
@317  = ~But right now, we have a quest to be getting on with--places to go, people to see, right?  Well, lets get going.~
@318  = ~Hmm.  Are you telling me that you magically procured the mushroom, uh, 'soup' that we had the other night, and didn't spend all evening slavering over the fire trying to perfect it, because it tasted like boiled cabbage?~
@319  = ~Yes!  I do have magical abilities, you know.  I am a spawn of Bhaal.~
@320  = ~Fine.  You win.  But you're cooking from now on!~
@321  = ~I hate you, forever and ever, and my hatred is pure.  I hope you die painfully and horribly, on a bed of boiled cabbage.~
@322  = ~It did not taste like boiled cabbage!  It tasted like mushroom!  Mushroom, damn it!~
@323  = ~Perhaps, but somehow, I doubt it.~
@324  = ~I would be more than happy to cook, if you will let me.  Because as I remember, unless you magically procured the mushroom, uh, 'soup' that we had the other night, which tasted like boiled cabbage, by the way, your cooking is terrible.~
@325  = ~Fine.  You win.  But you *are* cooking from now on!~
@326  = ~You have a point, there.  If you were, I'm sure we would all be long dead by now.~
@327  = ~You got me good, indeed.  Always next time, I suppose.~
@328  = ~Is there any point trying to argue?  (sigh)~
@329  = ~I do listen to you, yes.  When it suits me, of course.  But for now, let us continue our journey--there is much to do, as I recall.  Fighting Bhaalspawn, for one.  Defeating them.  Keeping their heads as trophies, of course.~
@330  = ~Truly?  Well, I shall endeavour to a 'horrible person' to you in future, then.~
@331  = ~I suppose so, yes.  But that does not account for the mess you caused, <CHARNAME>.  Surely a *Bhaalspawn* could have cleaned up?  Or perhaps not, in this case.  But for now, let us continue our journey--there is much to do, as I recall.  Fighting Bhaalspawn, for one.  Defeating them.  Keeping their heads as trophies, of course.~
@332  = ~I know, <CHARNAME>.  I know.~
@333  = ~Of course it did, <CHARNAME>.  Of course it did.~
@334  = ~As I said, I would be happy to.  But for now, let us continue our journey--there is much to do, as I recall.  Fighting Bhaalspawn, for one.  Defeating them.  Keeping their heads as trophies, of course.~
@335  = ~Watch yourself, <CHARNAME>.  I don't trust you, and I will watch your every move until I find that you have proved yourself.  But till then, remember that I will be watching you--and I'm not afraid to take action if need be.~ [LK#I160]
@336  = ~What's that supposed to mean?!~
@337  = ~I wouldn't be so cocky if I were you, Iylos--you don't know who you're dealing with here.  I am a Bhaalspawn.~
@338  = ~Whatever.  Look, I don't really care.~
@339  = ~You're very welcome to leave if you want, Iylos.  You know I'm not going to commit some atrocity--or should, by now.~
@340  = ~Watch yourself--exactly that.  I wouldn't have thought it terribly hard to understand.~
@341  = ~Are you threatening me?~
@342  = ~Watch *yourself*, you arrogant git.  I do have other things to do that stand here listening to you whine!~
@343  = ~I'm not stupid.~
@344  = ~(sigh) Look, Iylos.  I don't really like you, and you don't like me.  But we have a task to do--we have to stop this damned war, and I'm going to do that even if you aren't.~
@345  = ~My tutor was a Bhaalspawn; I know what you're capable of, <CHARNAME>.  Don't underestimate me.  I have watched you in battle; I have learnt your tactics, your weaknesses.~
@346  = ~Whatever- just go away!~
@347  = ~Perhaps, but I'm not going to take that risk.~
@348  = ~Whatever--just go away!~
@349  = ~It is not a threat; it is a promise, <CHARNAME>.~
@350  = ~I have more pressing things to do than to fight for you, but for some reason I continue to do so even though I no longer have to.  *I*, at least, am not proud of being a <PRO_SONDAUGHTER> of Murder, unlike you who revels in the slaughter.~
@351  = ~I would hope not, <CHARNAME>...I would hope not.~
@352  = ~I will aid you in stopping this war, and defeating the other Bhaalspawn; but I will *not* be party to any nefarious behaviour.  I hope you would have the sense to listen, and not ignore what I am saying.  I, at least, am not proud of being a <PRO_SONDAUGHTER> of Murder, like you who revels in the slaughter.~
@353  = ~Just bear it in mind, <CHARNAME>.~
@354  = ~So this could be the last time we see this accursed place, couldn't it?~ [LK#I232]
@355  = ~I can't say I'm unhappy about it.~
@356  = ~Neither am I.  I'll be glad to get out of here, have this over with.  (sigh)~
@357  = ~I'll miss it...even if it isn't exactly the most beautiful place, it's been there for me when I need it.~
@358  = ~Unhappy?  I'm ecstatic!  I can't wait to see the back of it.  God, I wish I could destroy it now!~
@359  = ~You don't have to like it.  But it is a place of power, and for that, I respect it.  I created this plane, if certain people are to be believed; this is part of me.~
@360  = ~It has gone on for a while, hasn't it, since Saradush?  At least it will be over soon, I suppose.  It will be nice to be able to go where I may without unwanted restrictions hanging over my head.~
@361  = ~I suppose.  At least all this will be over soon, I suppose.  It will be nice to be able to go where I may without unwanted restrictions hanging over my head.~
@362  = ~Well, soon you will be able to, <CHARNAME>.  It will be over soon--all of it, I suppose.  It will be nice to be able to go where I may without unwanted restrictions hanging over my head.~
@363  = ~A part of you which has grown and become- more, I know.  But I will not miss it.~
@364  = ~It will be over soon--all of it, I suppose.  It will be nice to be able to go where I may without unwanted restrictions hanging over my head.~
@365  = ~And so we come to the last of the Five which you have been so valiantly fighting against, <CHARNAME>.~ [LK#I165]
@366  = ~Balthazar, yes.~
@367  = ~In a little while...need to rest first, recuperate.  That last dungeon just took it all out of me.  (sigh) Sometimes I wonder if I'm really cut out for this adventuring business...~
@368  = ~I'd avoid killing him if I could.~
@369  = ~I know Balthazar.  He would not fight you if he felt you could help his cause.~
@370  = ~Which is?~
@371  = ~He does not want to resurrect Bhaal, as you may have suspected.  He wants to prevent it.~
@372  = ~Yes, I had gathered that much.  What else can you tell me?~
@373  = ~Really?  I thought he was just like the others...well, what do you suggest we do?~
@374  = ~Then I will be forced to kill him.~
@375  = ~He may not be averse to a...a truce, of sorts, perhaps.~
@376  = ~I cannot guarantee it, but I think if we play our cards right we can stop him from doing something drastic, and persuade him to help our cause.~
@377  = ~Well--I bow before your superior intellect, Iylos; how do you propose we do that?~
@378  = ~Maybe...I'm not sure.~
@379  = ~A truce?  With a Bhaalspawn?  You have to be joking.~
@380  = ~You *want* to resurrect Bhaal?~
@381  = ~Of course.  As soon as I learned it was possible, I have striven towards it as much as I could.  And now the moment is at hand...I won't have some foolish monk stopping me from returning my father to his due glory!~
@382  = ~Heh, I was just joking, Iylos.  But what do you suggest?~
@383  = ~Perhaps by appealing to his better nature.  Last time I spoke to him, he did not seem particularly welcoming...I suppose we'll have to wait and see.~
@384  = ~Last time I spoke to him, he did not seem particularly welcoming...I suppose we'll have to wait and see, if that is what you decide to do.  I would not discount Balthazar's help--he could be a powerful ally.~
@385  = ~Perhaps we could appeal to his better nature.  Last time I spoke to him, he did not seem particularly welcoming, however...I suppose we'll have to wait and see.~
@386  = ~Then you are doomed, <CHARNAME>.  If that is your intention--I will provide no aid to you.  Farewell, and I hope you realise the folly of your current course of action.~
@387  = ~I do not trust this place, <CHARNAME>.  It reeks of corruption and horror.  Can't you hear the screams in the background?  I don't know how you could stay here for long, yet alone sleep here...~ [LK#I163]
@388  = ~I don't.  I only come here when I absolutely need to, or are taken by the Solar.  I'd avoid it if I could.~
@389  = ~It isn't so bad, really, once you get used to the gloom.~
@390  = ~Oh, suck it UP, Iylos!  There's nothing wrong with the place.~
@391  = ~I like it.  The screams are almost...enjoyable.  Tantalising, one could say.~
@392  = ~I'm not surprised.~
@393  = ~Somehow, I find that hard to believe.~
@394  = ~So the darkness which pervades the air doesn't disturb you, the almost tangible death?~
@395  = ~Eh.  Not particularly.~
@396  = ~...where?!  I haven't noticed it...~
@397  = ~Yes, it does.  But where else can I be sure I am safe, if not in a place of my own creation?~
@398  = ~You disgust me, <CHARNAME>...you truly do.~
@399  = ~The very stones feel wrong, the ground beneath my feet makes not a sound as I move over it.  Nothing good can come of this place, <CHARNAME>.~
@400  = ~By the unpleasant expression on your face and the quickly pooling blood at your feet, <CHARNAME>, I deduce you've met this Saemon Havarian before.~ [LK#IBLN]
@401  = ~ Oh, yes.  He's a snivelling, pathetic excuse for a man, only interested in himself.  He's been helpful several times before, but it has always come at a drastic price.~
@402  = ~Saemon?  Bastard.  Does anyone not know Saemon Havarian, the most damned, wanted rogue on the planet?!~
@403  = ~Eh...I don't particularly care for him, but its just his way.  He can't help being the way he is, I suppose.~
@404  = ~I can imagine, if this situation is any example.  Some men are incorrigible...and unfortunately, I have a feeling we'll be seeing Saemon again.  According to the locals, he's become quite a fixture.~
@405  = ~But then again, some say that they have seen Drow around the place, so I'm not sure how much salt one should take with it.  Possibly a bag or so.~
@406  = ~I can imagine how much you dislike him, if this situation is any example.  Some men are incorrigible...and unfortunately, I have a feeling we'll be seeing Saemon again.  According to the locals, he's become quite a fixture.~
@407  = ~ If this situation is any example, he is totally incorrigible...and unfortunately, I have a feeling we'll be seeing Saemon again.  According to the locals, he's become quite a fixture.~
@408  = ~What an interesting Beholder.  I would have liked to learn more about him.  I had always thought such creatures were inherently evil.  Perhaps I was wrong.  Something to think on, at least.~ [LK#IBLN]
@409  = ~That was Spectator--we've met him a few times before.  Lovely chap, really, if a bit visible.~
@410  = ~You don't like being wrong very much, do you Iylos?~
@411  = ~I should have killed him the last time I had a chance.~
@412  = ~In the Underdark, I presume?  Ah...it must have been a fascinating experience.  Sendai will not wait for us, however--lu' ol's draeval whol ilta ulu el.~
@413  = ~It's time for her to die.~
@414  = ~Sendai will not wait for us,--lu' ol's draeval whol ilta ulu el.~
@415  = ~And so your pocket plane has transported us right into the middle of a group of enemy soliders--wonderful tactics, <CHARNAME>.  Perhaps you hoped the surprise would disable them or somesuch?~ [LK#IBLN]
@416  = ~Regardless, we must fight them now!~
@417  = ~Ah...I had forgotten the peculiar obsession the Drow had with spiders.  Wonderful--we already have to fight through an army of Drow Priestesses, mercenaries and wizards, and now we have a colony of enormous poisonous spiders added to the mix.  Just wonderful.~ [LK#IBLN]
@418  = ~It would almost seem as though she is trying to keep you here...but why would she do that?~
@419  = ~How unusual...perhaps we should investigate, <CHARNAME>.  As I remember, the prison is boarded up--perhaps this was the reason.~
@420  = ~<CHARNAME>, I didn't know you were of that persuasion...Perhaps I should pay more attention.~
@421  = ~Bhaal?!  Skeleton, you call this Bhaalspawn an abomination, and yet you are that much worse!  Whatever connection you have to Bhaal, consider it now severed!~
@422  = ~Prepare for your doom, vessel!  Spare none!  Bhaal will return!~
@423  = ~Ka dos daewl, Yathrin.  Usstan orn'la kre'j ulu z'haan ka Usstan zhahen dos--whol zhaunyl udos zhal elgg dos!~

@425  = ~Such youthful enthusiasm must be good for something--a well-chosen course of action, <CHARNAME>.  A little deceptive, perhaps, but...~
@426  = ~I must advise against this, <CHARNAME>.  Power does things to people, such as Amelissan here.  I am begging you...do not do this.  Don't become another Amelissan, or Irenicus, or Bodhi.~

@436  = ~Quite.~

@501  = ~What are you planning to do when this is all over, Iylos?~
@502  = ~Have you ever thought about growing your hair, Iylos?~
@503  = ~Why did you choose to become a monk?~
@504  = ~Why're you so tense, Iylos?  You're perfectly safe here in the Pocket Plane, as I have said...~
@505  = ~I have to admit, I've always wondered what it would be like to be bald.~
@506  = ~Isn't it difficult to keep your balance with such a big head?~
@507  = ~Iylos.  All this masculinity, pride and arrogance.  Are you compensating for something, perhaps?~
@508  = ~What do you think of our situation, Iylos?  Melissan, the Five?~
@509  = ~(You turn your gaze to the monk, his powerfully muscled back and arms obvious underneath his robe.  His gait is confident and wary.  The patterns on his head are covered in a slight stubble--he must have forgotten to shave this morning.)~
@510  = ~(He turns around to face you for a moment, his eyes unreadable, before returning to his constant vigil of your surroundings.  You can't help but notice his slight smile.)~
@511  = ~(Surreptitiously you turn to observe Iylos, who is as usual lost in thought, his eyes scanning the horizon for danger or perhaps something else.  His deep, usually clear blue eyes are clouded slightly, and his face looks downcast.)~
@512  = ~Are you alright, Iylos?~
@513  = ~What're you so dark about, Iylos?~
@514  = ~(Leave him alone)~
@515  = ~I'm...fine.  Contemplating what the future holds.  There is so much ahead of you--us.  Much danger, and many foes.  Let us hope we survive.~
@516  = ~I'm contemplating what dark secrets our future may hold.  There is much ahead of you--us.  Much danger, and many foes.  Let us hope we survive.~
@517  = ~(Iylos' slow movements are fluid and graceful, yet there is an element of inevitability and power withheld beneath his simple seeming gestures.  His eyes are open, thoughtless and still as he balances upon one foot, the other held in lotus position just below his waist.)~
@518  = ~(His arms perform a series of sweeping gestures, finally concluding in a prayerlike position on his chest.  After a moment, he notices your stare and blinks at you.)~
@519  = ~This is the flying horse, <CHARNAME>.  It is one of the simplest movements in yoga--it is said to be the epitomy of grace.~
@520  = ~(You notice Iylos' breathing slow as he closes his eyes, still walking.  He seems aware of his surroundings, and yet does not acknowledge them as he moves.  He is murmuring a chant of some kind which you can't quite make out, but sounds strangely foreign and alluring.)~
@521  = ~(His expression is very peaceful and serene, and his manner slightly detached.  After several more moments he opens his eyes and although his breathing is once more normal, the aura of calm surrounding him remains.)~
@522  = ~Do you mind, <CHARNAME>?  I'm not sure you realise how hard it is to meditate when another is watching you.~
@523  = ~(You increase your stride to match that of the monk, and within a few moments you are right beside him.  With a casual motion you reach out to touch his arm, and slowly move downwards to his wrist.  He glances at you briefly, a glare hidden beneath his usual mask, and detaches your hand.)~
@524  = ~Do you mind, <CHARNAME>?!  I'm trying to think.  Leave me alone.~
@525  = ~(You carefully stroke Iylos' arm, his cool skin smooth beneath your fingers.  The tips of his ears redden ever so slightly, and he withdraws his arm.)~
@526  = ~<CHARNAME>, what are you doing?~
@527  = ~Flirting with you.  What does it look like?~
@528  = ~Nothing.~
@529  = ~You needn't be so tense.  I wasn't attacking you, and there are no foes about.~
@530  = ~I would appreciate it if you did not do it again.~
@531  = ~(Iylos looks at you suspiciously, before turning away.) If you say so.~
@532  = ~There is a reason I am tense, <CHARNAME>, and it has nothing to do with enemies.  Do not think that you can win me over with 'innocent' touches or compliments--I am not so easily won.~
@533  = ~(Iylos glances at you, his blue eyes alighting upon your friendly smile.  His eyes narrow briefly before turning back to the road, his eyes resolutely upon the ground in front of him.)~
@534  = ~(You smile at Iylos, but his gaze slides off you as water from a duck.  At first it seems he did not even notice, but after a moment it becomes evident that he is smiling faintly in return, even if he is busying himself with adjusting his robe.)~
@535  = ~Why would I smile, <CHARNAME>, when there are hundreds dying even as we speak?  Perhaps you should concern yourself with the more pressing issues at hand, such as where you're intending for us to sleep tonight and how you will end this damned war.~
@536  = ~If you wish, <CHARNAME>, but I don't see how a smile could help anything--world hunger, for example.  *Surely* your time would be better spent preparing for battle?~
@537  = ~I wasn't suggesting a smile would solve anything, but sometimes it can light up the day even when all seems hopeless.  I'd suggest trying it sometime.~
@538  = ~You never know if you don't try!~
@539  = ~Perhaps, but you have such a handsome smile.  I'd like to see it more often.~
@540  = ~(You creep up behind Iylos and poke his stomach; you can feel his taut muscles underneath your fingertip.  In a flash, you find yourself on the ground, your arm sore and aching.)~
@541  = ~Care to try that again, <CHARNAME>?  Hmph.~
@542  = ~(You poke Iylos in the back and leap back, quickly looking in the opposite direction, an innocent smile upon your face.)~
@543  = ~(Iylos sighs and turns around to face you.) Was there something, <CHARNAME>?~
@544  = ~No, nothing.~
@545  = ~Yes, actually.  What're you thinking about?~
@546  = ~You're so boring!  Why can't you have a little fun once in a while?!  (Pout at him)~
@547  = ~Why birds have such an unerring sense of direction and inherent knowledge of when and where danger will strike.  Have you ever noticed, in a storm, the birds will always fly in the opposite direction, even if the storm is nowhere to be seen by your eyes?~
@548  = ~I had noticed that, yes.~
@549  = ~No, actually, I hadn't...but now that I think about it, you're quite right.  Birds are some of the most amazing creatures.~
@550  = ~Bollocks!~
@551  = ~I do have fun when I have the time, <CHARNAME>, but we have this little war on our hands at the moment, if you hadn't noticed.  Perhaps you should attend to it rather than poking me at random moments.~
@552  = ~Such unusual traits must surely be magical.  But let's return to the road--not getting anywhere with idle chatter, are we?  (He turns away from you abruptly.)~
@553  = ~If you believe so--I think that such unusual traits must surely be magical.  But we're not getting anywhere with idle chatter, are we?  (He turns away from you abruptly.)~
@554  = ~(You sharply jab Iylos in the back, and blink as you find your wrist quickly encircled by his hand.)~
@555  = ~<CHARNAME>, what *are* you trying to do?~
@556  = ~Get close to you, of course, so I can jab you in the back.  Exactly what I just did, actually.~
@557  = ~Nothing--'twas a mistake, I assure you.~
@558  = ~Whack you!  (Poke him with your free hand)~
@559  = ~(Attempt to pull free)~
@560  = ~I see.  (Iylos lets go of your wrist, his own falling limp by his side.)~
@561  = ~Do not do it again.~
@562  = ~(Iylos glares at you, irritated.) I see.~
@563  = ~(He lets go of your wrist, his own falling limp by his side.  He looks pointedly at your other hand, paused in the action of poking him.) Do not do it again.~
@564  = ~(Iylos glares at you, irritated, for a moment.)~
@565  = ~(You expertly cuff Iylos over the back of the head, lightly enough so it doesn't hurt but hard enough to incite a reaction.  Iylos turns around, arms folded on his chest, his face an icy mask of dislike.)~
@566  = ~What part of 'leave me alone' do you not understand, Bhaalspawn?!  I am quite well off without your incessant bothering.  Hmph.  (Iylos continues glaring at you for a moment before striding away stiffly.)~
@567  = ~(Carefully, you sneak up behind Iylos and within the space of a moment you step up to his back, almost every part of you touching.  He stands rigidly, shocked.  You lean forward and mumble into his ear, barely making any sound as your lips brush his ear.)~
@568  = ~(You feel him shiver, though he does not move for several moments.)~
@569  = ~(Suddenly, he turns around, his eyes blazing, his mouth a thin line of anger.)~
@570  = ~Touch me again, <CHARNAME>, and I will be gone before you can utter a word.  (He stalks away furiously, and refuses to talk to you for some time.)~
@571  = ~(You lean forward and whisper nonsense into Iylos' ear, barely containing your suppressed laughter.  He moves backward slightly, til you're almost touching, and turns around.)~
@572  = ~You are a fool, <CHARNAME>, if you think you can alter how I feel about you and your *gifts* by courting me.  Leave me alone, and do not attempt to do so again!~
@573  = ~(Without a moment's hesitation you lean over and blow fiercely into Iylos' ear.  The man in question blinks owlishly for a moment, as though he could not believe what had just happened, and walks away shaking his head.)~
@574  = ~(You sidle up to Iylos on the pretense of making conversation and lean over, supposedly to tell him something important.  Instead of words what issues forth from your mouth is a burst of wind, which travels right to Iylos' ear.  He jumps, surprised, and shakes his head as if to empty it of something.)~
@575  = ~(He gives you a look of long-suffering tiredness, and suddenly you find your ear filled with wet finger.)~
@576  = ~(Scream and jump backwards)~
@577  = ~(Grab his hand and pull it away from your head, tutting.) Iylos, really.  Can't you do better than that?~
@578  = ~Argh!  Ugh, Iylos, that's disgusting!!~
@579  = ~(Iylos smirks at you.) Just don't do that again, <CHARNAME>, or I will do a lot worse.  I give as good as I get, when the mood strikes me.  (He turns away, but not before giving you another long-suffering look and hints of a glare.)~
@580  = ~Of course.  I was just looking for something just as childish and immature as what you just did to counter.  I *do* give as good as I get, when the mood strikes me.  (He turns away, but not before giving you another long-suffering look and hints of a glare.)~
@581  = ~I suppose that is alright.  Just...don't continue bothering me.  I have better things to do than watch you play games.~
@582  = ~No, I do not.  I think the separation of peoples is useless, and only serves to cause discontent with those who are poorer or less well-off.  But then again, if all were suddenly to become equal, there would always be those who sought to tip the balance of power to their favour.~
@583  = ~I think whatever we do, there will always be those who are more successful businessmen, more successful artists, more successful fishermen, more successful fighters.  To take that away would take away what makes us human; our individuality.  Everyone has their strengths and weaknesses.~
@584  = ~I apologise, I did not mean to ramble.  I do not agree with classes, but I can see the reason for their existence.~
@585  = ~Yes, I have.  Several years back, before the Iron Crisis.  I did not like it at all...too many people, too much intrigue and too much activity.  I would not care to go there again.~
@586  = ~(Iylos looks startled for a moment.) I don't mind them, but they aren't my first choice of food, no.  I am rather partial to custard tarts, however.~
@587  = ~Water has always been sufficient for me; alcohol confuses the mind and weakens the body, and I would not care to be caught unawares--in any situation.~
@588  = ~I have no favourite animal, and neither does this topic concern our quest.  I would appreciate it if you would stop bothering me and get back to the quest at hand.~
@589  = ~That is none of your business, and I intend to keep it that way.  Please leave me alone, <CHARNAME>, I have no wish for idle chatter.~
@590  = ~(Iylos' face tightens, and his eyes narrow.) Why would you be interested in such a morbid question, <CHARNAME>?~
@591  = ~No reason, just wondering.~
@592  = ~Because it interests me...when I kill, there's the exhilaration of the hunt, and the adrenalin rush of the final blow.  Of course, the regret hits me afterwards, but it is not important and easily dismissed.~
@593  = ~When I kill, my mind is a blank slate; death is my purpose, and there is no point evading my fate.  I was just wondering what it was like for another.~
@594  = ~It isn't morbid, I wish to know purely for scientific reasons.~
@595  = ~I'm not, I'm just--I don't like death. I hate it, and I wish I didn't have to kill.~
@596  = ~Then you would not mind if I do not answer the question.~
@597  = ~You truly are a spawn of Bhaal.  (Sigh)~
@598  = ~No, I did not.~
@599  = ~When I fight, there is only one thing upon my mind; find a weakness, and strike.  If I can, I will render the enemy unconscious, but the circumstances surrounding our quest do not look kindly upon such behaviour.  It would be no good if enemies begin to wait until dark to attack, seeking revenge for the damages we have done them.~
@600  = ~You didn't answer my question.~
@601  = ~(Iylos raises an eyebrow.) Yes, it looks fine.  A little windblown perhaps, but fine nonetheless.~
@602  = ~The forget-me-not.~
@603  = ~Why the forget-me-not?~
@604  = ~What's a forget-me-not?~
@605  = ~Alright.~
@606  = ~I like the blue colour painted upon its petals; it reminds me of the desert sky on a clear day.  Calm, peaceful, and with a lingering regret that night must come to pass.~
@607  = ~A forget-me-not is a small blue flower which sticks to fabric.  I like the blue colour painted upon its petals; it reminds me of the desert sky on a clear day.  Calm, peaceful, and with a lingering regret that night must come to pass.~
@608  = ~Not particularly--there was no time for such frivolities in the monastery, <CHARNAME>.  'Treats', as such, were not allowed.  We were given another kind of reward for good behaviour.~
@609  = ~What was that?~
@610  = ~Makes sense.~
@611  = ~If we behaved well in lessons, we were taken to the city and allowed to wander its boundaries.  We did not get out very often, unless it was to work or meditate, so such visits were treasured above almost all else.  Enough of that, however...let us get back to the road.~
@612  = ~Yes, I have.  I quite like the Dales, frigid though they are.  I stayed in Luskan, even visited the small town of Kuldahar--one day I would like to return there, it was breathtaking.  The Spine of the World is, indeed, very beautiful...but just as perilous.  That could explain why I like it so much.~
@613  = ~Blue.  But, really <CHARNAME>--must you ask such frivolous questions?!  We have tasks to be doing, and shouldn't be standing around idly discussing our favourite things.~
@614  = ~The scent of roses in the early morning.  Or possibly freshly baked bread.~
@615  = ~Ah...Volo.  I don't like him at all--a pompous fool, always exaggerating tales of his and others' exploits.  I'm constantly surprised by how well his books sell, but I suppose it really should not.~
@616  = ~I once met Volothamp; we were at an inn, and he was harassing the owner for a tale about several famous adventurers who had just passed through; I believe it was Drizzt and his followers.  I intervened and politely asked a few questions of my own, and after reading Volo's notes showed them to the owner of the inn, who promptly threw Volo out of the establishment and thanked me, throwing the notes into the fire.  (Iylos chuckles.)~
@617  = ~What did the notes say?~
@618  = ~Heh, yeah.~
@619  = ~As I remember, it was something along the lines of how the inn was thoroughly disreputable, and how the owner was surely a tramp of some kind.  Volo's way of getting back at him for refusing to divulge details of Drizzt's stay, I suppose.  Pathetic.~
@620  = ~Since I was a child.  He was my best friend, then my tutor, and then my Master.~
@621  = ~<CHARNAME>, I am tired of answering your questions.  Leave me be!~
@622  = ~Sometimes, yes.  But self-hatred never gets one anywhere.  We all make mistakes; sometimes terrible, and we must deal with the consequences of those mistakes, whether it be by doing a good deed or suffering our conscience.  Everyone handles it differently.  Not that you would know, of course, <CHARNAME>; being a Bhaalspawn and all.~
@623  = ~Yes, I do.  The sunsets in the desert are spectacular...gold, red, and orange, spraying out from the remnants of the dying sun.  One day I hope you see it, <CHARNAME>, so you can see the true beauty of the desert--and gain some modicum of respect for it.~
@624  = ~No, I do not.~
@625  = ~Perhaps, but it is none of your concern.  Please cease prying into my business, <CHARNAME>, it is not an area you wish to dabble in.  (Iylos' eyes take on a dangerous glint as he turns away.)~
@626  = ~Usually some form of shelter is available, even if it is just in the form of a rocky outcropping or an overhang.  Caves are also good to sleep in; they provide warmth and protection from the elements.  I'm fairly sure we won't be needing to resort to any of those things, but they are there if needed.~
@627  = ~The city of Neverwinter?  No, I have not.  I have heard many things about it, and none of them good, however.~
@628  = ~It depends on my mood--and right now, my mood is annoyed.  Cease your damned questions, and leave me be!~
@629  = ~I had no choice in the matter; I was raised in a Monastery, among many monks.  What else would I have done?~
@630  = ~No, it was become a monk or a scholar, and I had no wish to spend all day inside a cage of knowledge and books.~
@631  = ~Of course--we can continue doing it each morning before sunrise, if you wish.~
@632  = ~No thanks...I'd just like to do it one more time.~
@633  = ~Do you like chicken?~
@634  = ~Life has been hard for us all, <CHARNAME>, not just you.  That does not excuse such rudeness.~
@635  = ~Still, I apologise.  It was not my intention to say what I did, it just...happened.~
@636  = ~Look, I'm no good at this.  Just--sorry.  Okay?~
@637  = ~I'm sorry, Iylos.  What more could you want?!~
@638  = ~Why even bother apologising if you're going to act like that?~
@639  = ~In theory.  But this place is so ominous...the very sky screams unnatural doom.~
@640  = ~You get used to it after a while.  Really, you do.~
@641  = ~I created it; do I scream unnatural doom?~
@642  = ~I...I know what you mean.  But I created it, apparently...so it can't be all that bad...can it?~
@643  = ~You're just pathetic and weak.~
@644  = ~Perhaps my comment was out of line, <CHARNAME>, but you cannot say what you did and then expect one to act like all was fine.  Leave me alone, <CHARNAME>, I have no wish to speak to you any further.~
@645  = ~Then I expect you up at dawn tomorrow morning.  (Iylos smiles at you faintly.)~
@646  = ~If you wish--though practice makes perfect, they say.  Are you sure?~
@647  = ~Yes, quite.  Thanks, but no thanks.~
@648  = ~Actually, I think I will do it a bit more than that...do you mind teaching me some more?~
@649  = ~(After a moment's pause, Iylos begins to laugh.) Is that a yes or a no, <CHARNAME>?~
@650  = ~A definite yes.~
@651  = ~A no.  (Grin)~
@652  = ~Do not expect a simple apology to right what you said, <CHARNAME>, but it is accepted.  For now.~
@653  = ~For some strange reason, that doesn't comfort me in the slightest.~
@654  = ~Do you really want me to answer that question, <CHARNAME>?~
@655  = ~Ah...perhaps not, then.~
@656  = ~(Roll your eyes)~
@657  = ~Yes!~
@658  = ~Must you act immature?~
@659  = ~And you are nought but a self-obsessed raven, in twain, to quote one famous poet.  Leave me to my thoughts, <CHARNAME>, I am not interested.~
@660  = ~(Iylos shrugs.) Your choice.~
@661  = ~If you want to learn more, then I expect you up at dawn tomorrow morning.  (Iylos smiles at you faintly.)~
@662  = ~(Iylos loses his usual composure for a moment, and flashes you a grin.)~
@663  = ~If you wish.  Yes, in answer to your question.  (Iylos loses his usual composure for a moment, and flashes you a slight grin.)~
@664  = ~You have a large task ahead of you, <CHARNAME>--I would not want you going in all by yourself.  You might get hurt!~
@665  = ~Better I come along and look after you, don't you think?~
@666  = ~I can handle myself, Iylos.  You don't need to baby me.~
@667  = ~Whatever.  It would have been nice of you to just say 'that's okay, <CHARNAME>, I don't mind' instead of giving me this bullshit.~
@668  = ~Heh, you might be right, at that.  Anyway--thank you.~
@669  = ~If you say so, <CHARNAME>.  If you say so.  (He grins slightly.)~
@670  = ~I was just being humorous.  There is no need to get up in arms about it.~
@671  = ~No problem at all, <CHARNAME>.~
@672  = ~I know some things, but the vast majority of plant and herb lore has evaded my interest so far.  Perhaps one day I will become interested in it, but for now--I would prefer to know the art of battle than that of healing.~
@673  = ~Leila studied at the Monastery for a short time before becoming embroiled with...family, so to speak.  She was to quit studying and acquire a job, earn money, or face the prospect of having her child taken away from her.~
@674  = ~It was not a happy situation.  I joined the Monastery several years after she had left, but she still visited the Monastery, sometimes brought us food from the Inn and stories of the outside world.  She was almost like a universal mother to us students, even though she was only several years older than us.~
@675  = ~She did not support my decision to leave the Monastery, and almost made me stay.  Leaving was...hard for me, and having to leave Leila and little Keira made it no easier.~
@676  = ~But I don't want to speak of this any further--I have delved enough into past incidents to satisfy your curiosity, surely.~
@677  = ~Bitter?  I don't think of myself as bitter...but perhaps it is because each day, I see so much I have not experienced, not done, not tried.  Things I have missed out on, and *can't* try.  Life is not endless, and my thread is, doubtless, nearing its middle.~
@678  = ~Maybe that helps you, a little.  But I do not think of myself as bitter.  Dark, perhaps.  But not bitter.~
@679  = ~The night holds many dangers, beyond that of the day.  You can't see where you're going--at least, I can't; sound is somewhat enhanced, but vision goes out the window, so to speak.  I find that incredibly frustrating.~
@680  = ~So, no, I do not like the night.  It has dangers hidden to our eyes, and has a tenuousness I would rather not have to face each and every time it comes upon Faerun.~
@681  = ~A friend, yes.  You have proved yourself somewhat worthy of my friendship, and as such, I will treat you as one.~
@682  = ~A traveling companion; a friend would be a severe distortion of the truth.~
@683  = ~I am not terribly sure.  Return to the Monastery for a time, perhaps, or return to the deserts.  I feel that I have not finished traveling, and would like to continue--perhaps visit the Dales once more, or to Luskan.~
@684  = ~Long hair is not helpful in combat, <CHARNAME>, as you know.  It was mostly a personal decision to shave my head; though keeping it smooth is an endless, unsatisfying task, I prefer that to not being able to see.~
@685  = ~I'm just doing my job, Bhaalspawn.  Do you have a problem with that?~
@686  = ~Actually yes, I do.  If your job simply consists of being prejudiced and rude, Iylos, then I would rather you go.~
@687  = ~Of *course* not!  I mean, I'm sure *you* wouldn't mind being eyed like a fat mouse by a hungry cat, would you?~
@688  = ~Iylos, please, there is no need for hostility here.  I'm just asking you to trust me a little.  Obviously I'm not going to harm you or any other innocents; I haven't so far, why should I now?~
@689  = ~Surely you can see that I mean only good, Iylos?  Must you persist with this suspicion?~
@690  = ~Would 1000 gold, perhaps, ease your suspicion somewhat?~
@691  = ~Leave.  Me.  Alone.  I need some room to work, I can't do what I need to do with you constantly breathing down the back of my shirt.~
@692  = ~Actually, it doesn't matter.  Don't worry about it.~
@693  = ~I am doing my duty to one I am loyal to, and you would do well to at least respect that.  Or is the concept of honour and loyalty something that is unfamiliar to you?~
@694  = ~(Stay silent)~
@695  = ~I am quite familiar with honour and loyalty and respect those who exhibit these traits.  However, I would appreciate it if you would give me a bit of breathing room and allow me to work without your constant watching.  I know you mean well, and that you have reason to be suspicious of me, but everything you have seen so far of me has been good, has it not?.~
@696  = ~MY command stands.  Leave if you wish, Iylos, I'm sick of your tired obsession with 'duty!.~
@697  = ~Iylos, just back off a little.~
@698  = ~Please, Iylos, just do as I ask.  You can't observe me when I feel like I have to watch my every move, because it isn't how I truly am.  Look at it from that perspective.~
@699  = ~Humour, <CHARNAME>?  Since when has that been a part of your make up?  Not that it matters.  I am not a cat, stalking my prey, just waiting for a chance to attack.~
@700  = ~Just because you haven't harmed any innocents so far does not mean you don't have any intention of doing so in the future, <CHARNAME>.  Don't attempt to dissuade me from my task, it will not work.~
@701  = ~Iylos, this is foolishness.  You know as well as I do that I'm not going to harm anybody I don't need to.~
@702  = ~I'm not trying to dissuade you from your task.  I'm asking you to at least trust me enough to let me do what I need to without you questioning my every move!~
@703  = ~I don't kill unless it is a necessity.  You, of all people, should understand that.~
@704  = ~Fine!  I give up.  In the future, watch yourself; you may find yourself on the wrong end of a sword, or perhaps a fist.  Either way...~
@705  = ~(Iylos' eyes flash.) You would try to *bribe* me, <CHARNAME>?!  You are truly a despicable <PRO_MANWOMAN>, and I will leave this...this *party* as soon as I possibly can.  If you weren't under the protection of the Five I would kill you where you stand!~
@706  = ~The...five?~
@707  = ~The five?  I think I've heard of them...aren't they a group of people out to *kill* Bhaalspawn?~
@708  = ~Iylos, don't even let yourself consider the notion that you would be able to kill me.  I am a *Bhaalspawn*, I have powers you couldn't dream of.~
@709  = ~(Cluck your tongue) Iylos, I don't think your Master will be very happy with that little display!  Come now...do you REALLY have any intention of leaving this party, or are you just bluffing as I suspect?~
@710  = ~I will do what I can to stop you from being in the way!  I have no intention of harming you or any other who has not caused *me* harm.~
@711  = ~Pah, I thought not.  Don't try to best me, <CHARNAME>; you will find it is *not* worth your while.  Either way...~
@712  = ~I admit a grudging respect for your abilities, <CHARNAME>- but not for you personally.  I have yet to see any great feat which could make me trust you; no heavenly wonder with which to convince me of your innocence.~
@713  = ~Just because you haven't done anything so far does not mean you aren't thinking about doing it in future.~
@714  = ~I have my orders, and I will *follow* them!  Whether or not I have your support doesn't matter to me.  If you force me to leave, I will trail you unobserved and draw my conclusions regardless.~
@715  = ~I was just joking, Iylos...you can stay.  But please, *please*, give me some space.~
@716  = ~Leave then.  Goodbye.  As long as I don't have to deal with you in my face all the time!~
@717  = ~I don't take kindly to intimidation, Iylos.  You are free to leave, but if I find you, *anywhere* near me again, you will regret the moment your god-forsaken 'master' told you to join me.  Pray our paths do not cross again!~
@718  = ~You can stay...for the moment.  But one more out of line move; one more situation where you take over or get in my way and you're gone.  A friendly warning, shall we say.~
@719  = ~I have my orders, <CHARNAME>, and I will follow them.  I would be lax in my duty if I did not watch you as carefully as I do, and I cannot have that upon my head.  That's all there is to it.~
@720  = ~I suppose that's fair enough.~
@721  = ~Iylos, you're becoming repetitive.  I tire of this argument...please, at least *consider* putting down your guard, just a little.  If only that, and nothing else.~
@722  = ~Someday soon, Iylos, you will see how very wrong you are in this situation.  I have only the best of intentions, and until you see that, you are blind.~
@723  = ~I'm absolutely *awed* by your determination to disregard everything I say, Iylos.~
@724  = ~Perhaps.  Either way...~
@725  = ~No, I do not.  You say that, but I have yet to see it for yourself...you kill those you could spare, and you disregard those you do.  I see no compassion there.~
@726  = ~The Five are just some of the people who are interested in you, <CHARNAME>--as I have told you before, you are becoming rather famous.  Infamous.  Whichever you prefer.  Either way...~
@727  = ~Don't try to best me, <CHARNAME>; you will find it is *not* worth your while.  Either way...~
@728  = ~I will think on it, <CHARNAME>, but for now...we will see.~
@729  = ~Perhaps, but I will do what I believe is right regardless of your opinion, Bhaalspawn.  Remember that.~
@730  = ~I will do what I believe is right regardless of your opinion, Bhaalspawn.  Remember that.~
@731  = ~Fine, but beware...*I* do not take kindly to intimidation, Bhaalspawn.  Goodbye...for now.~
@732  = ~Indeed.~ [LK#I102]
@733  = ~Much like yourself--I can see why you hold him in such high esteem, Iylos.~
@734  = ~Balthazar is a very enigmatic man.  I can only hope he fights for the same cause as us.~
@735  = ~A pathetic man...obsessed with mundane virtues such as loyalty and obedience.  Why concern yourself with him so?~
@736  = ~(Stop conversing)~
@737  = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>.  He is a powerful man, in more ways than one, and it is an honour to serve him.~
@738  = ~I'm sure.  No wonder you were so reluctant to disobey him; I'm sure he would see it as a betrayal.~
@739  = ~He is a powerful man, indeed.  I appreciate you vouching for me, Iylos.~
@740  = ~Us?  I fight for Balthazar's cause, <CHARNAME>--do not think that because I vouched for you that I will blindly follow your lead.  I will continue to aid you for a time, until I feel that I have done my part in this.~
@741  = ~Thank you, Iylos.  I appreciate it.~
@742  = ~Of course--I meant in general.~
@743  = ~Thank you for continuing your help, regardless--I would be lost without it.~
@744  = ~Because, <CHARNAME>, he is worthy.  Perhaps unlike yourself.~
@745  = ~Indeed.  I would never dream of betraying one such as Balthazar.~
@746  = ~I can understand why.~
@747  = ~I apologise for my...reluctance to accept that you were simply doing your job.  Regardless, lets get going.~
@748  = ~Let's get going, then.~
@749  = ~I was just doing what I believe is right, <CHARNAME>.  Do not think that I will blindly follow your lead, however; I will continue to aid you for a time, until I feel that I have done my part in this.~
@750  = ~It is my pleasure, <CHARNAME>.~
@751  = ~A man I hold great trust and respect for- that is all you need to know for the time being.~
@752  = ~I was raised in Amkethran, yes.  What is it to you?~
@753  = ~Oh, nothing...I was just wondering.~
@754  = ~You were raised in Amkethran?  Where were you born?~
@755  = ~I was raised in Candlekeep...my mother died when I was very young.  I was raised by a man called Gorion.~
@756  = ~Amkethran isn't the place for a child...so dusty, so dry.  Surely you had a terrible childhood?~
@757  = ~Were you raised in the Monastery, or...?~
@758  = ~I see no reason to share my past with you, <CHARNAME>; I am here because I must, not out of any wish to get to know you.  Keep that in mind.~
@759  = ~Putting two and two together isn't that hard...you were raised in Amkethran in a Monastery, you have not mentioned any parents to speak of, and you either don't know or aren't willing to share where you were born.  Are you...are you an orphan, Iylos?~
@760  = ~Monks could not have the best of parents...~
@761  = ~A Monastery is not the best place to raise a child, surely?~
@762  = ~That isn't a question, <CHARNAME>.  Are you quite finished?~
@763  = ~I grew up with my half-sister, Imoen.  We did everything together...quite often we got in trouble with Gorion and the monks, but we grew up okay.~
@764  = ~I grew up in Candlekeep, as I said, though I don't consider it my home.  Gorion was weak, pathetic, and his death forced me to come to terms with the world.~
@765  = ~Yes, I am--now it is your turn to tell me something.  A truth for a truth.~
@766  = ~Gorion was a kindly old man, though not much of a father.  Did you have a father figure as you grew up?~
@767  = ~Yes.  Does it matter?~
@768  = ~No, it doesn't--I was just curious.  Sorry for prying.~
@769  = ~Yes, actually it does.  You see, I, too, was an orphan.  Funny how things work out, isn't it?~
@770  = ~(Remain silent)~
@771  = ~Of course not...I apologise, but I had to know.~
@772  = ~No, they were not.  Leave me be, <CHARNAME>, I have no interest in discussing this with you.~
@773  = ~Maybe not, but I survived.  Leave me be, <CHARNAME>, I have no interest in discussing this with you.~
@774  = ~(Iylos is silent, and waits for you to continue.)~
@775  = ~...That's all, really.~
@776  = ~Did you have someone, like I had Imoen?  Someone your own age?~
@777  = ~Look, I'm sorry to have brought it up.  It doesn't matter, you obviously aren't interested.~
@778  = ~Gorion, from all that I've heard, was a very honourable and good man--a Harper, in point of fact.  And you say he was weak and pathetic?~
@779  = ~Yes, I do!  He just went off and died, left me to fend for myself without giving me a moment's notice!~
@780  = ~Perhaps that was an exaggeration...he was a good and honourable man, yes.  But he had no strength when it came to us; he died at a time when I needed him the most.~
@781  = ~Look, it doesn't matter...don't worry about it.~
@782  = ~I am an orphan, as you may have suspected.  I grew up in the Monastery, but I got bored with my Monastic training and left.  There.  Are you satisfied?~
@783  = ~Yes, thank you.~
@784  = ~No, I'm not--why did you leave?~
@785  = ~Fair enough...thank you.  I've got one last question, though...Why are you so secretive about your past with me?  I've never been anything but friendly and yet you remain aloof and unfriendly.~
@786  = ~No, I did not--the monks were not what you would call suitable parents.  I have no wish to discuss this with you, <CHARNAME>...~
@787  = ~Of course.  I apologise.~
@788  = ~You might not, but I do.  I like to know about my companions, thankyouverymuch.~
@789  = ~Of course.  You're...forgiven, I suppose.~
@790  = ~Indeed.~ [LK#I102]
@791  = ~I thought not.~
@792  = ~I see.  I did not have one such as Imoen to grow up with; no sister or brother to share joy or sadness with.  I have accepted that.  That's enough of this conversation, any more and it will become maudlin.~
@793  = ~I did not have one such as Imoen to grow up with; no sister or brother to share joy or sadness with.  I have accepted that.  That's enough of this conversation, any more and it will become maudlin.~
@794  = ~You're...forgiven, I suppose.  Let's get moving.~
@795  = ~He did not leave you without a moment's notice, <CHARNAME>--no father would ever do such a thing.  You, at least, had a father.  Think on that before you go accusing Gorion of being 'weak' and 'pathetic'.~
@796  = ~I highly doubt he would die without cause, <CHARNAME>.  But that is your business, not mine, and I would prefer to keep it that way.~
@797  = ~If that is what you wish.~
@798  = ~I left because I had to.  I am not the type to stay in a monastery my entire life, I had to go out into the world and seek out inner peace.  Many wished me to stay, but I felt a drive to explore and the desert became my paradise, forever unveiling new mysteries and answering questions no human ever could.~
@799  = ~You're forgiven, <CHARNAME>.  It is just not a subject I wish to speak about with you.~
@800  = ~You will survive, I suspect.~
@801  = ~I was raised in Amkethran, yes.  What was it that you wanted to know, <CHARNAME>?~ [LK#I104]
@802  = ~If you're sure.~
@803  = ~I was an orphan.  I was given to the Monastery when I was very young, and I was never told who my parents were, why they left me there or where I was born.~
@804  = ~I'm sorry.~
@805  = ~Oh, Iylos...(Hug him)~
@806  = ~I was an orphan as well...I was raised by Gorion in Candlekeep, but I never knew my mother.  I didn't know about my...father, I suppose, until Gorion's death.~
@807  = ~That...isn't really a question, <CHARNAME>.  (Iylos smiles slightly.) Are you finished, or did you have more to add?~
@808  = ~It was hard in many ways, but I am the better for it.  "What doesn't kill only makes you stronger" was one of the first lessons I learnt in the Monastery.~
@809  = ~The monks were kind, but they weren't the best of parents--they didn't know how to deal with an overactive child, so they set me to work and study.~
@810  = ~I was happy, in a way.  I never knew any other way; it was then that I befriended one of the younger monks, a man named Balthazar.  He was kind to me, and took me under his wing.  I owe a lot to him.~
@811  = ~I have to admit, I can't really imagine Balthazar being your mentor...(Smile slightly)~
@812  = ~You've mentioned Balthazar before...but I won't invade your privacy any more.  Thank you for telling me, Iylos.~
@813  = ~It was much the same in Candlekeep--Gorion took me under his wing and taught me what he knew, and Imoen and I grew up under his direction and that of the monks.  So I suppose we aren't so different...in one way, at least.~
@814  = ~I'm glad your childhood was a happy one, if hard.  Not many are as lucky in that respect.~
@815  = ~Yes, I was raised in the Monastery...let me explain.~
@816  = ~It is well in the past, <CHARNAME>, and though I harbor a regret that I never met my parents, I do not regret growing up in the monastery.  I'm fine.~
@817  = ~You do know people say 'I'm fine' even when their world is collapsing, don't you?~
@818  = ~I'm glad you grew up the way you did, Iylos...otherwise you wouldn't be the same man you are now, who is helping me achieve balance in a life which is so fabulously torn it is sometimes hard to see which way to turn.~
@819  = ~I'm sorry to have brought it up, Iylos.~
@820  = ~I regret not meeting my mother...I definately don't regret not meeting my father, though I have...sort of met him, I suppose.  In a way, I meet him each time I fall asleep.  (Sigh)~
@821  = ~It is well in the past, <CHARNAME>, and though I harbor a regret that I never met my parents, I do not regret growing up in the monastery.  I must admit, I hope you don't have such a regret that you never met your father...from what I hear he seems rather ominous.~
@822  = ~Aha, ah.  Hah.  Hah.  Iylos, *please*...your humour would be more suited to cattle than humans.  Don't inflict it upon one such as me.~
@823  = ~Ominous only *begins* to describe Bhaal...though I'm sure even Bhaal himself would have the manners to not bring up another's questionable heritage.  (Glare at him)~
@824  = ~No, I don't regret that I never met my father...(Grin)~
@825  = ~(Iylos is silent and waits for you to continue.)~
@826  = ~I am an orphan, as you may have suspected.  I grew up in the Monastery, under the tutelage of the monks and Balthazar, who was to become my teacher in the monastic way.  I eventually left in search of inner peace, and found the Anauroch desert.  Is that enough?~
@827  = ~No, its not--why did you leave?~
@828  = ~No, I did not--the monks were not what you would call suitable parents.  The ones I was close to were more like older friends who occasionally acted in the parental roles, but they were never true parents, only in terms of discipline.~
@829  = ~It was hard in many ways, but I am the better for it.  What doesn't kill can only make you stronger was one of the first lessons I learnt in the Monastery.~
@830  = ~The monks were kind, but as I have said, they weren't the best of parents--they didn't know how to deal with an overactive child, so they set me to work and study.~
@831  = ~I was happy, in a way.  I never knew any other way; it was then that I befriended one of the younger monks, a man named Balthazar.  He was kind to me, andtook me under his wing.  I owe a lot to him.~
@832  = ~Perhaps not, but that is what occured nonetheless.~
@833  = ~Indeed, perhaps not.~
@834  = ~Thank you.  No, they are not...not all have the privilege of being clothed and fed each night, and having a place to sleep in.  We *were* lucky, in that respect.  In others, though...perhaps not.~
@835  = ~(Iylos chuckles) Indeed...but I *am* fine.  For the time being, anyway.~
@836  = ~Thank you for that rather underhanded compliment, <CHARNAME>.  I hope I am helping, and I am sorry for the problems I caused you when you first agreed to let me travel with you.  I am a better man for my childhood, and for that I am grateful.~
@837  = ~It's alright, <CHARNAME>--it is not your fault.~
@838  = ~I wish it were otherwise, <CHARNAME>...I truly do.  Having the bane of Bhaal upon you cannot be easy, to be torn between what is right, and what is easy.  Perhaps...perhaps there is something I *can* help you with, but not now.  Another time, perhaps.~
@839  = ~I would like that, thank you, Iylos.~
@840  = ~Sure.~
@841  = ~We'll see.~
@842  = ~I'm sure you will survive somehow, <CHARNAME>.  But in future, I will make sure to direct my humour to more willing participants, perhaps.  (Iylos grins at you.)~
@843  = ~I apologise, <CHARNAME>, it was not my intent to cause offense.~
@844  = ~It's alright...just don't do it again.~
@845  = ~Bah.~
@846  = ~(Sigh) Don't worry about it, Iylos...it isn't your fault.  Its just a sensitive issue with me is all.~
@847  = ~(Iylos grins back.)~
@848  = ~ I did not have one such as Imoen to grow up with; no sister or brother to share joy or sadness with.  I have accepted that.  I sometimes regret that I did not, though.~
@849  = ~I did not have one such as Imoen to grow up with; no sister or brother to share joy or sadness with.  I have accepted that.  I sometimes regret that I did not, though.~
@850  = ~It's alright.~
@851  = ~I highly doubt he left you without good cause, <CHARNAME>--no father would ever do such a thing.  You, at least, had a father.  Think on that before you go accusing Gorion of being 'weak' and 'pathetic'.~
@852  = ~I highly doubt he would die without cause, <CHARNAME>.  But that is your business, not mine, and I would prefer not to pry.  Thank you.~
@853  = ~Still, I apologise.  It was inappropriate and rude, and I am not one to usually vent such feelings.  To the road, then, I suppose.~
@854  = ~Many reasons, <CHARNAME>, and perhaps I shall even explain some to you.  When I left the Monastery, I was fighting with a powerful urge to travel, to explore the unknown and see what was over the next hill.  I travelled to places such as Baldur's Gate and beyond, even to Neverwinter, without finding what I was looking for.~
@855  = ~I met some interesting people, did some interesting things, but it did not hold me captivated for very long.  I wandered listlessly, surviving on the generosity of people and whatever gold I could earn from working.~
@856  = ~(Interrupt) What sort of work did you do?~
@857  = ~(Interrupt) What didn't hold your captivation?  Travelling, or the cities you travelled to?~
@858  = ~(Let him continue)~
@859  = ~(Iylos glares at you, irritated.) Guarding people, adventuring, building--many things.~
@860  = ~(Iylos glares at you, irritated.) A little of both.  Anyway...~
@861  = ~I made my way back to the Monastery, feeling somewhat crestfallen and dark.  I threw myself into my training, and quickly become one of the most powerful warriors in the Monastery, second only to the Masters and Balthazar.  But I never graduated--I had the strength, the physical skills, but I did not have peace of mind.  I was turbulent, much like yourself.  My mind was a rush of ideas and thoughts, and as much as I and my tutors tried, I could not master my mind.~
@862  = ~Angry at my inability to focus and meditate, I fled into the desert, hoping I would find some answer there.  I came across an...underground encampment, so to speak, who took me in for a while and taught me their language.  But I was forced to move on.~
@863  = ~During my travels through the desert, I learnt many things about both myself and my surroundings--the serenity of the desert brought peace to me, and I felt at home.  It was inexplicable, a slight shift in my awareness, but I'd found a home, and I still regard it as such.~
@864  = ~Well...that was disappointing.  I was hoping for a more interesting story, epic battles with frightening sand-creatures and tragic heartbreaks, perhaps.~
@865  = ~Candlekeep was never truly my home...I don't have one.  I'm a vagabond, really, I travel where I must and at times wherever my feet take me.  You're lucky to have somewhere you can call home.~
@866  = ~It suits you, I suppose.~
@867  = ~Of course you were--I purposely omitted those.~
@868  = ~You mean you DID fight giant sand-creatures and had tragic heartbreaks?!~
@869  = ~Ah...okay.  Why?~
@870  = ~Fool.  I hate you forever and ever!~
@871  = ~I suppose I am, yes.  The desert is where I feel the most comfortable, as strange as it may seem to a city-dweller like yourself.~
@872  = ~Watch who you're calling a city dweller!~
@873  = ~It does seem a little strange, but I can see where you're coming from.  Thank you for telling me, Iylos.~
@874  = ~It's weird, thats what it is.~
@875  = ~How so?~
@876  = ~Well, you're harsh and sometimes unpredictable.~
@877  = ~Uh...doesn't matter.  Forget about it.~
@878  = ~You can be calm one moment, and then completely change your outlook the next...the desert can look peaceful one moment, and suddenly a raging tornado can appear.  Much the same.~
@879  = ~Perhaps, but you'll just have to wait until I'm ready to tell you, won't you?~
@880  = ~Because I don't particularly feel like sharing those details with you.  I'm sure you understand.~
@881  = ~I see.  That is, of course, your choice--but the reason why I'm not telling you is because I don't feel the need to, and it is quite personal.  I'm sure you understand.~
@882  = ~Well, I suppose you grew up in a remote castle rather than a city, but it is much the same.~
@883  = ~No its not, its nothing like the city!  There were monks, and books, and a small town...okay, maybe it was a bit like a city, but nowhere near as much as Amkethran!~
@884  = ~(Sigh) Don't you understand *anything*?  A city is big, and contains thousands of people.  Candlekeep had hundreds, at most.~
@885  = ~If you wish to think so.~
@886  = ~(Iylos looks lost for words, and after a moment laughs.)~
@887  = ~I have to admit, that was not entirely what I was expecting.  Perhaps.  I can be harsh and unpredictable at times, I suppose...~
@888  = ~If you wish.~
@889  = ~(Iylos looks thoughtful.) Perhaps you are right.  Something to contemplate.~
@890  = ~You have a point--Amkethran is at least larger than Candlekeep.  Not that it matters...you spend the majority of your time adventuring, as do I.  We can no longer be classified as 'city dweller' or 'desert dweller' but rather 'adventurers'...strange how these things work.~
@891  = ~Underneath Anauroch, there are several enclaves of Drow- I was forced to learn their language to survive when I first ventured into the desert.  It was learn Drow, or die.~
@892  = ~Tough decision.~
@893  = ~Even still...why could you not go somewhere else without Drow?~
@894  = ~Drow is a complicated language, quite gutteral.  It took me months to grasp the rudiments, but once I began to understand it came a lot more easily.  Some of the Drow there were followers of Good, especially the goddess Eilistrae, so it was not so horrible to associate with them.~
@895  = ~Whatever--that doesn't change the fact that the Drow are a terrible people.  I don't understand how you could *live* with them.~
@896  = ~I see your point.~
@897  = ~Why did you have to live with the Drow?  Couldn't you have gone somewhere else?~
@898  = ~The Anauroch desert is huge; the chances of coming upon civilisation or even habitation are extremely slim in such an area.  I was lucky to have discovered the Drow.  Eventually they drove me out, much to my chagrin--but some sympathised with my plight and led me to a small human habitation.  I survived, and grew from the experience--but the Drow aren't all as bad as you might at first think.~
@899  = ~The Anauroch desert is huge; the chances of coming upon civilisation or even habitation are extremely slim in such an area.  I was lucky to have discovered the Drow- if I had not, I would have surely died.

I survived, and grew from the experience--but the Drow aren't all as bad as you might at first think.~
@900  = ~I was involved in negotiations with her concerning 'her' swamp.  The temple she inhabited was the hereditary property of one of the monks, and she was disgusted by the state which Nyalee had left it in.  It was one of the most complicated situations I had ever been in, and nothing was clean cut.~
@901  = ~(Remain silent and wait for him to continue)~
@902  = ~What happened?~
@903  = ~I didn't ask for your life story, Iylos!  Just tell me what happened without all the other additions.~
@904  = ~Eventually I confronted the old hag about it, and she said that she had obtained the land from the monk's father and that it was rightfully hers.  I did some things that I'm not proud of.~
@905  = ~I couldn't help but feel sorry for the woman once I'd spoken to her more; she was bitter, broken, and was not capable of compassion or empathy due to the choices she made during her life.  But she riled me into a furor with words of poison, and I...I hit her.  I felt bones shatter from the impact, and with a scream of rage she sent the undead, the inhabitants of the swamp after me.~
@906  = ~I fled under the onslaught, and once back in the Monastery I learned a terrible truth--the monk had lied.  She was thrown out from the Monastery once she was discovered, and I was forced to return to Nyalee's swamp to apologise and make recompense for my terrible actions.  She was unconscious, and there were none of her 'friends' to be seen; I placed a potion of healing by her side, 300 or so gold and a small magical trinket which I hoped would help bring back her sanity.~
@907  = ~She awoke, and looked upon me as a stranger; she did not recall why her bones were broken, nor that it was I who had broken them.  She began to babble about her 'son', Yaga Shura, and his betrayal.  She tore the pendant I had given her from her neck and smashed it, swearing as she did so her revenge upon him.~
@908  = ~She had forgotten I was there, so I left as unobtrusively as I could.  I doubt she even recognised me when you spoke to her, but for some reason I suspect she may remember such as you due to your connection with Yaga Shura.~
@909  = ~Strange how these things work...she does not remember anything about the breaking of her bones, but she remembers the giant and his apparent betrayal of her.  She is a sad creature, eternally condemned to hatred and vilification of both herself and her son.~
@910  = ~How...how sad.  I almost feel sorry for her.~
@911  = ~She deserved what she got...she sold her heart for life.  She does not deserve pity.~
@912  = ~How pathetic, that you would lose your temper so easily...and on a defenceless old woman, at that.  I'm disgusted at you, Iylos.~
@913  = ~You asked, <CHARNAME>, so you will listen to what I have to say.~
@914  = ~You would, wouldn't you?  But it matters naught...what happened happened, and my message remains; you mustn't trust Nyalee, she's crazy.  Let's get moving...but keep my story in mind when dealing with her.  She can change her mind in an instant, and will attack on provocation- and with her 'friends,' the undead, she is no small challenge.~
@915  = ~I'll keep that in mind.  Thank you, Iylos.~
@916  = ~I think that's the longest speech I've ever heard you say!~
@917  = ~I will think on this.~
@918  = ~Perhaps, but it matters naught...what happened happened, and my message remains; you mustn't trust Nyalee, she's crazy.  Let's get moving...but keep my story in mind when dealing with her.

@919  = ~I am not proud of what I did, but it matters naught...what happened happened, and my message remains; you mustn't trust Nyalee, she's crazy.  Let's get moving...but keep my story in mind when dealing with her.  She can change her mind in an instant, and will attack on provocation- and with her 'friends' the undead she is no small challenge.~
@920  = ~Heh, indeed--but it is something which you needed to know about, I felt, so I told you.  Think on it, <CHARNAME>, if only for your own benefit.  Take my advice, and do not trust a word Nyalee says, whatever she may offer or promise.  Let us get going.~
@921  = ~It is something which you needed to know about, I felt, so I told you.  Think on it, <CHARNAME>, if only for your own benefit.  Take my advice, and do not trust a word Nyalee says, whatever she may offer or promise.  Let us get going.~
@922  = ~Don't you think you've learnt enough, <CHARNAME>?  (sigh)~
@923  = ~What would you like me to remind you or teach you?~
@924  = ~'Hello, how are you?'~
@925  = ~'Drow scum, I hope you burn in hell.'~
@926  = ~ 'On your knees, male!'?~
@927  = ~'Wonderful morning, is it not?  And how are the children?'~
@928  = ~'Damn.'~
@929  = ~Teach me how to say fuck in Drow.  Come on.  Please?~
@930  = ~Actually, no thanks.  I don't need it.~
@931  = ~'Vendui, lu'oh ph' dos?'~
@932  = ~'Ilythiiri srow, Usstan kestal dos flamgra wun uoi'nota.'~
@933  = ~'Pholor dosst la'uren, jaluk!'.~
@934  = ~'Bronretla kre'tan, zhah ol naut?  Lu'oh ph' l' dalharen?'~
@935  = ~ 'Xsa'.~
@936  = ~If you must know, it is 'Vith', though Drow do not usually use the word.~
@937  = ~And anticipating your next question--to call someone one is 'Vith'rell'.~
@938  = ~I could teach you a little, if I have no alternative.  I prefer not to speak it, but I suppose I can teach you some, at least.~
@939  = ~What would you like to learn how to say?~
@940  = ~How about 'Hello, how are you?'~
@941  = ~Surprise me.~
@942  = ~Perhaps 'On your knees, male!'?~
@943  = ~'Wonderful morning, is it not?  How are the children?'~
@944  = ~'Iylos, would you please just teach me the basics?  I'd actually like to know the language, not just bits and pieces of it.~
@945  = ~I'd like to learn how to swear in Drow.  Mostly so other people don't know what I'm saying when I swear at them.~
@946  = ~That is fairly simple.  Repeat after me; 'Vendui, lu'oh ph' dos?'~
@947  = ~It's hard to learn Drow without actually immersing yourself in Drow culture...wait a moment.  You already have.  Didn't that Silver Dragon cast a spell on you to make you appear as Drow, and speak their language?  What happened to it?~
@948  = ~It wore off eventually, as most spells do.  So, are you going to teach me, or not?~
@949  = ~It's still there.  I just wanted *you* to teach me.~
@950  = ~I knew you liked telling people what to do, what so say, how to act...so I thought you might appreciate the gesture.~
@951  = ~Alright.  But I'm not going to tell you what it means- you can ponder that yourself.~
@952  = ~Dosst heen zhah sreenath, drill xal dosst b'luth'ol zotreth seke.~
@953  = ~I should have known it would be something like that, <CHARNAME>.  'Pholor dosst la'uren, jaluk!'.~
@954  = ~How prosaic.  'Bronretla kre'tan, zhah ol naut?  Lu'oh ph' l' dalharen?'~
@955  = ~That would come in handy, I suspect, for one such as you.  Alright...how about we learn a basic one.  Repeat after me: 'Xsa'.~
@956  = ~Put more emphasis on the X.  So it's more like 'ksa'.  That's right.  That means 'damn'.~
@957  = ~Here's another; 'Flamgra wun uoi'nota, nuij.' It means 'burn in hell, fiend.' You may find it useful in our upcoming battles.~
@958  = ~Ah...no, I don't think I will.  If you want to learn, go back to Ust Natha, or perhaps to some other Drow city.  I do not wish to dirty my tongue with this foul language any more than necessary.~
@959  = ~You wanted *me* to teach you?  Well, I'm afraid I have to decline.  If you want to learn, go back to Ust Natha, or perhaps to some other Drow city.  I do not wish to dirty my tongue with this foul language any more than necessary, especially if you already know it.~
@960  = ~Hardly.  Leave me alone, <CHARNAME>--I have far better things to do than have you point out my faults.~
@961  = ~Relationship?  Sexual relationship, you mean to say?~
@962  = ~Well...yeah.~
@963  = ~No, I mean falling in love with the moon.  Of course I mean sexual relationships.~
@964  = ~No...another way to phrase it would be; have you ever fallen in love?~
@965  = ~Yes, I have.  But only briefly.  It...did not end too happily, for either party.~
@966  = ~Oh.  Sorry for bringing it up.~
@967  = ~Hah, bet she couldn't stand you!~
@968  = ~I have.  It did not end too happily--for either party.~
@969  = ~It didn't work out.~
@970  = ~That's all?~
@971  = ~And?  You can't just leave me hanging like this!~
@972  = ~Well, la-di-da.  So it didn't work out.  No need to be so emotional about it.~
@973  = ~It's alright.  It happened, and there is nothing I can do about it.  It's not something I particularly like to discuss, so if you'll excuse me.~
@974  = ~*HE* had to leave.~
@975  = ~...He?!~
@976  = ~Eww!  That's disgusting, Iylos!~
@977  = ~Aww, how cute!~
@978  = ~I didn't know you were into guys, Iylos.~
@979  = ~I don't feel--comfortable talking about this, <CHARNAME>.  So if you would be so kind as to excuse me, I would greatly appreciate it.~
@980  = ~No need to be sorry, <CHARNAME>.  It happened, and there is nothing I can do about it.  It's not something I particularly like to discuss, so if you'll excuse me.~
@981  = ~If you don't want to know, <CHARNAME>, there is a simple solution--don't ask.~
@982  = ~Yes, he.  Do you have a problem with that?~
@983  = ~Yes!  That's...that's disgusting!~
@984  = ~No, not at all.  I happen to think it's all kinds of awesome, actually.~
@985  = ~Not really.  Just don't...do anything while I'm around.~
@986  = ~So *that's* why you're so--so bitter!  You've never been able to come out, your entire life...oh, Iylos...~
@987  = ~Yes, but that isn't going to stop me from adventuring with you.  I don't let such things come in the way of a professional relationship.~
@988  = ~Actually, that kind of thing turns me on.~
@989  = ~You...you like...guys?  Why didn't you tell me before?~
@990  = ~Iylos, you never mentioned--I like guys, too!  I mean...~
@991  = ~Then I see no point in continued conversation.~
@992  = ~Cute?~
@993  = ~Perhaps.  Well, thank you, I suppose.  I did not mean to let such a thing slip, but at least you aren't terribly fazed by it.  Let us...let us continue on our journey, if we may.  This is not terribly familiar territory, and I- lets just get going.~
@994  = ~Do you have a problem with that?~
@995  = ~Awesome?~
@996  = ~Hmph.  I did not mean to let such a thing slip, but at least you aren't terribly fazed by it.  Let us...let us continue on our journey, if we may.  This is not terribly familiar territory, and I- lets just get going.~
@997  = ~Hmph...~
@998  = ~I don't require your pity, <CHARNAME>.  And that is--hardly the case.  Must we speak about this?  It is not exactly familiar territory, and I- lets just get going.~
@999  = ~That's--that's great, <CHARNAME>, but...ah...don't we have to get going?  Have we got somewhere we need to be?~
@1000 = ~We- really should get going.  About now.  Excuse me.~
@1001 = ~It isn't exactly something one broadcasts world over, <CHARNAME>.  Must we--speak of this?  I did not mean to let such a thing slip, but at least you aren't terribly fazed by it.  Let us...let us continue on our journey, if we may.  This is not terribly familiar territory, and I- lets just get going.~
@1002 = ~I've noticed.  It isn't exactly something one broadcasts world over, <CHARNAME>--but at least it is, perhaps, something we have in common.~
@1003 = ~Now, lets never speak of it again.~
@1004 = ~Yes.  But I'm hardly about to tell you, <CHARNAME>, so begone.~
@1005 = ~My thoughts are my own business, and they would influence your own conclusions.  However, I feel something is amiss--what, I'm not sure.  We should keep our eyes open and ears to the ground, in any case.~
@1006 = ~(He raises an eyebrow skeptically.) I'm not bald, <CHARNAME>. I shave my head each morning.~
@1007 = ~How come I've never seen you actually do it?~
@1008 = ~Each morning I wake up before the sunrise, while you are still snoring.  It always surprises me you do not swallow things in your sleep, with your mouth open like that.~
@1009 = ~Sounds like you've done a fair bit of "observing," Iylos...tell me; do you have a crush on me?~
@1010 = ~Hey! Well, at least I'm not the one wearing a dress.~
@1011 = ~Very funny.~
@1012 = ~Hardly.  The very fact I'm speaking with you is some sort of miracle, I imagine; as I have said before, I would much rather be elsewhere.  Preferably without your presence to mar the atmosphere.~
@1013 = ~You know full well this is no dress, Bhaalspawn.  If your only intent is to insult me, then I suggest you leave me be.  I would not deign to react to such idiocy.~
@1014 = ~I rather thought so.~
@1015 = ~What masterful wit, <CHARNAME>.  Perhaps next time you will compare me to a duck?  At least it might be mildly entertaining to watch you trip over your tongue.~
@1016 = ~(Iylos snorts derisively.) And here I thought you had some maturity.  How foolish of me.~
@1017 = ~Paladins?  Righteous men with too little occuring between their ears, or at least, that is the case of many.  There are few paladins I have met who see the subtle greys, the tonal shifts which all too often occur, and that makes them unable to truly understand good and evil.  They see it in stark black and white, good and evil, when there is so much more at work.~
@1018 = ~Of all people, I identify with druids the most.  They understand the need for solitude, what can be learnt from silence and contemplation and careful consideration.  Nature is a powerful and wondrous thing, and they understand its importance in the grand scheme of things.  I feel that they do more good than a lot of people, especially those who give no thought to what they kill.~
@1019 = ~I find them somewhat useless and annoying, with their constant songs and poetry.  I have little respect for those who do not spend their time appropriately.~
@1020 = ~I can identify with the rage they justify themselves with, but I don't think it is the correct way to channel rage.  Some berserkers believe that their rage is the most pure emotion, and in a way, I can see what they mean; but I do not think that it is the best and most efficient way to do battle.~
@1021 = ~Magic?  Is not each day a work of magic, <CHARNAME>?  There are so many different forms of magic, and yet you limit yourselves to one.  I believe magic is a very powerful force, and it can do great things.  But it can also do great evil, and corrupt.~
@1022 = ~So in retrospect, I'm in two minds about what *you* term as magic.  On one hand, it can be a force of great good and great evil, but on the other, it cheapens the miracles of every day.  Childbirth, life, death--these are miracles which occur constantly, and yet we do not regard them as such, because we are so preoccupied with the idea of magic.~
@1023 = ~Is that a good thing?  You tell me.~
@1024 = ~He is a good man with little in the way of intelligence, but he has a great heart.  I'm not sure what to think of his--hamster, Boo, but I have seen a great many things, and it would not particularly surprise me if Minsc's announcements about him proved to be true.~
@1025 = ~I do not agree with the idea of someone using a lockpick to enter a house uninvited, but I believe sometimes such a skill is necessary to one's survival.  While I may not agree with a thieve's doctrine, they can be useful, when the situation calls for it.~
